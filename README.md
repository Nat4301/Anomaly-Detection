Anomaly Detection from Stochastic Differential
Equation realizations
Generative AI technologies can be maliciously used for misinformation, therefore detection
tools need to keep up with the rapid evolution of generative AI. We frame the problem of
detecting fake data in time series as an anomaly detection problem. This project intends to
develop a pipeline for detecting synthetic audio using stochastic differential equation (SDE)-
based modeling and interpretable machine learning.
The proliferation of generative audio models has intro-
duced new challenges in verifying the authenticity of spo-
ken content. Detecting synthetic audio is critical in ap-
plications such as prevention of misinformation, biomet-
ric security, and the integrity of digital media. Traditional
audio classification relies heavily on spectral descriptors,
however, these may overlook subtle temporal anomalies
present in fake generated audio.
This project introduces a hybrid approach that com-
bines stochastic differential equation (SDE)-based mod-
eling with spectral feature extraction to identify fake au-
dio by recognizing it as an anomaly. By analyzing the
dynamics of Mel spectrogram time series and augment-
ing them with statistical and machine learning classi-
fiers, we construct an interpretable and effective detection
framework. The approach emphasizes mathematical rigor
through residual analysis of SDEs while leveraging data-
driven insights through SHAP-explained ML models.
1 Stochastic Differential Equations
Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) are differential
equations that incorporate random noise, commonly mod-
eled by Brownian motion or Wiener processes. They are
used to describe systems where evolution over time is in-
fluenced by both deterministic trends and inherent random-
ness. One of the most common uses is the Black-Scholes
model, which is a mathematical model for the dynamics of
a financial market containing derivative investment instru-
ments.
Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)
A Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) models the
evolution of a variable over time under both deterministic
and random influences. The general form is:
dXt = µ(Xt,t)dt + σ(Xt,t)dWt
(1)
where:
r Xt is the stochastic process
r µ(Xt,t) is the drift term, representing deterministic
trends,
r σ(Xt,t) is the diffusion term, representing random fluc-
tuations,
r Wt is a Wiener process (standard Brownian motion),
r dt is an infinitesimal time increment,
r dWt is a random increment with mean 0 and variance dt.
An SDE realization is a single sample path (trajectory)
generated by solving the SDE numerically, typically using
methods like Eulertextbf–Maruyama. Each realization re-
flects a possible evolution of the process over time.

1.1 Processing
To prepare the audio signals for analysis, each waveform
is first normalized and converted into a Mel spectrogram,
which represents the signal’s energy distribution across
perceptually spaced frequency bands over time. This trans-
formation captures both spectral and temporal dynamics
of the audio in a compact, interpretable format. From the
Mel spectrogram, statistical features are extracted for each
Mel band, such as range, smoothness ratio, and increment
statistics. In parallel, a SDE is fit to each band’s time series
to estimate dynamic properties like drift and noise residu-
als. Additionally, global spectral features such as MFCCs,
spectral centroid, bandwidth, flatness, roll-off, and zero-
crossing rate are computed directly from the waveform
to characterize the signal’s timbre and structure. Together,
these features form a high-dimensional representation that
encapsulates both deterministic trends and subtle stochas-
tic variations useful for anomaly detection.

spectrography
1.1.1 Models
Following a construction of a dataset from the extracted
features a few models can be developed to solve this
anomaly detection problem. To classify audio clips without
using machine learning, we implemented a rule-based al-
gorithm based on statistical deviation. First, we computed
the mean (µ) and standard deviation (σ) of each audio
feature across a corpus of real clips. For every new clip,
we calculated a Z-score for each feature using Z = |x−µ|
σ
to measure how far it deviated from the real-audio norm.
Features with Z-scores exceeding a defined threshold were
flagged as abnormal. If the number of abnormal features in
a clip surpassed a second threshold, the clip was classified
as fake. The two tunable parameters—the Z score thresh-
old and the feature count threshold—were optimized in a
validation set to balance sensitivity and specificity. This ap-
proach offers interpretable anomaly detection based solely
on statistical principles. We secondly also used a Random
Forest algorithm to also simulate what an approach would
be if using ML-based models. A Random Forest is an
ensemble-based machine learning method that constructs
multiple decision trees during training and aggregates their
predictions for classification. Each tree is trained on a ran-
dom subset of the data with replacement, and at each node,
a random subset of features is considered for splitting. For
classification tasks, such as distinguishing real from fake
audio, the Random Forest outputs the class chosen by the
majority of trees. This method is robust to overfitting, han-
dles high-dimensional data effectively, and provides inter-
pretable outputs through feature importance scores, mak-
ing it well-suited for tabular data with complex feature in-
teractions like those extracted from audio signals.

We can then test our models on a test data and construct a
confusion matrix and calculate confidence or shap values to
see our results and which features contribute the most to the
final model. These results will be displayed in a confusion
matrix and the feature importance will then be graphed.
2 CONCLUSION
This project presents a hybrid approach to synthetic au-
dio detection by integrating stochastic differential equa-
tion (SDE)-based time series analysis with spectral fea-
ture extraction. The combination of mathematically in-
terpretable SDE residual modeling and statistical or ma-
chine learning classifiers enables effective identification
of fake audio content. Results show that both rule-based
and Random Forest models can successfully distinguish
real from generated speech, with SHAP analysis enhanc-
ing model transparency. This methodology not only pro-
vides strong detection performance but also maintains in-
terpretability—making it a promising framework for se-
cure and trustworthy audio authentication systems.
